# Welcome to My Portfolio!

Hi there! I'm glad you're here. This is my personal portfolio built with **React JS** and **SCSS**. As an aspiring Computer Science Engineer, I am excited to showcase my skills and experiences through this platform.

I am actively seeking an internship opportunity where I can learn from experienced professionals and contribute positively to the growth of a dynamic organization. With a strong passion for problem-solving and continuous learning, I hope to make a meaningful impact using my technical knowledge and interpersonal skills.

In this portfolio, you will find various projects I have worked on as part of my academic curriculum and freelance work. Each project highlights different aspects of web development such as **UI/UX design**, **frontend development**, **backend integration**, and **responsive layouts**. Feel free to browse around and check out what interests you the most!
